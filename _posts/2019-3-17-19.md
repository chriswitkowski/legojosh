Today we tested out a new power citrus juicer using the first of the Meyers lemons from the dwarf citrus tree on our patio.  Delicious!  The lemonade was even better than expected, so good we had to toast!  Also enjoyed fresh squeezed OJ, but not from our own tree (stay tuned, that crop is growing).
