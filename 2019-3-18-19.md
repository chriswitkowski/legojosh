It's official, we can now playfully refer to our family website simply as 'Our South Bay Family', or oursouthbayfamily.com.  Or even oursouthbayfamily.org or .net or .info, take your pick!  We wanted something that was first and foremost easy for us to remember for ourselves, and broadly descriptive in a way that is hopefully interesting in exploring with us as we navigate life in the 'South Bay Area' or 'Silicon Valley', California.
